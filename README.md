SLANG.NET
=========

A port of the [SLANGFORDOTNET C#](http://slangfordotnet.codeplex.com/) by [Praseed Pai](http://praseedp.blogspot.in/). to VB.NET

SLANGFOR.net is an attempt to teach Compiler Construction using C# and the .NET platform. The Programming language was created for a BarCamp session which was held @ Technopark, Trivandrum , INDIA. The Project has been hosted in CodePlex as part of the Presentation (on SLANGFOR.net ) for Community Tech Day event @ Kochi ,Kerala , INDIA(which was held on 30th january 2010).

Here I try to port the C# implementation to VB.NET
